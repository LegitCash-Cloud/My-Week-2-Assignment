THIS REPOSITORY DOCUMEMTS WEEK 2 OF MY JOURNEY IN DATA ANALYTICS WHERE I FOCUSED ON DATA CLEANING AND DATA TRANSFORMATION.I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CLEAN AN EXCEL FILE, FORMAT, SORT AND FILTER TO ORGANIZE THE DATA AND REMOVE DUPLICATE CELLS, ALSO I WAS ABLE TO IMPORT A TEXT FILE AND MANUALLY TRANSFORM IT, USED FUNCTIONS LIKE RIGHT, LEFT, LEN AND VALUE TO CLEAN UP TEXT DATA AND I GOT TO USE THE FLASH FILL OPTION ON THE DATA RIBBON AND THE FIND & REPLACE OPTION ON THE HOME RIBBON
